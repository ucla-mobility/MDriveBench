"""
BasicAgentPlanner — wraps CARLA's built-in BasicAgent so its hazard check
consumes our Detection list (perception output OR ground-truth oracle) instead
of querying ``world.get_actors()``.

This is the experimental scaffold for the perception-as-only-independent-variable
study. CARLA's lateral PID, longitudinal PID, route following, and traffic-light
handling are all reused unchanged — they are battle-tested in the Leaderboard.
The ONE thing that varies between matrix cells is the Detection list passed in:

    perception output  → real run     (bottleneck = detector quality)
    world.get_actors() → GT oracle    (bottleneck = planner only — the control row)

Compared to RulePlanner this trades the home-grown 50-line steering+brake logic
for CARLA's PID controllers. That isolates the comparison: any closed-loop
failure in a "real" detector run that does NOT also fail under GT is attributable
to perception, not the planner.

        meters AHEAD of route[0] (e.g., scenario_runner's pre-tick physics
        steps move the ego ~5 m forward between spawn and the agent's first
