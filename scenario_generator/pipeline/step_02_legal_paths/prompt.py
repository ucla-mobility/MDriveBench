    Writes a prompt-ready TEXT file (copy-paste into your LLM).

    OPTIMIZED FOR PATH PICKING:
    - The prompt includes a COMPACT candidate list that is easy for an LLM to scan.
    - It intentionally omits heavy per-segment fields (e.g., segments_detailed) because those
      often degrade selection accuracy by adding noise and increasing context length.
    - If you need segment-level placement (e.g., "immediately after the turn"), use the
      machine-readable JSON output (--out-json-detailed) after the path is selected.

    The compact candidate schema is:
      {
        "name": "...",
        "entry": {"cardinal4": "N", "heading_deg": 90, "road_id": 9, "lane_id": 1},
