"""Glue between :mod:`tools.run_custom_eval`, :mod:`tools._carla_pool`, and
:mod:`tools._scheduler`.

This module exists to keep the surface area of ``run_custom_eval.py``
small when ``--scenario-pool`` is enabled.  It translates between the
concepts owned by ``run_custom_eval`` (``PlannerRequest``, grandchild
argv construction, env assembly, result-dir finalize path) and those
owned by the pool/scheduler.

Responsibilities
----------------
* ``extract_town_from_scenario``: discover which CARLA town a scenario
  requires, from its route XML.
* ``build_scenario_job_list``: produce a flat ``list[ScenarioJob]``
  across all planners/scenarios.
* ``spawn_grandchild_for_lease``: spawn a grandchild for one
  ``(ScenarioJob, CarlaLease)`` pair (Phase 2c will flesh this out once
  the main() integration surface is understood).
* ``finalize_result_from_run``: invoke existing
  ``write_run_status`` / ``finalize_failed_result_roots`` helpers.

Every symbol from ``run_custom_eval`` that this module needs is imported
lazily inside functions (to keep import graph shallow) or passed in
explicitly by main().

             elapsed since the SNAPSHOT line was written. Without the
             elapsed correction, a 30s-stale snapshot would forever report

        Bug context: prior to this layered logic, scenarios stuck inside
        agent_call (no new ticks → no new SNAPSHOT) would keep reporting
        the SAME stale age forever. We observed scenarios silent for 47 min
        with the parser returning 33s as "current age", causing the 600s

        to ``world_port`` and signal it. Returns the targeted PID or None
        if not found.

        Two-stage signal escalation:

          1. Send **SIGINT** to the process group. The leaderboard registers
             a SIGINT handler at ``leaderboard_evaluator_parameter.py:253``
             which forwards to ``ScenarioManager.signal_handler`` -- this
             sets ``self._running = False`` so the main loop exits at its
             next iteration. Once the loop exits, the evaluator runs its
             normal termination path including ``_register_statistics()``
             which writes per-ego ``results.json`` with the criteria state
             at kill time. The recorded status reflects what the in-process
             criteria observed (e.g. ``"Failed - Agent timed out"`` for a
             stuck ego) -- NOT a fake "success".

          2. After ``CARLA_POOL_STUCK_KILL_GRACE_S`` seconds (default 60),
             if the process is still alive (signal was queued but never
             delivered because the main thread is wedged in C-extension
             code such as a futex / RPC stall), escalate to **SIGKILL**.

        Why not SIGTERM as before? SIGTERM has no handler in the leaderboard
        and immediately kills the process. ``_register_statistics()`` never
        runs, per-ego ``results.json`` is empty, and the wrapper's
        classifier marks the run as a hard infrastructure failure (``rc=-15``
        / ``rc=-9``) instead of recording the actual planner-stall outcome.

        Why not block waiting for clean exit? The escalation runs in a
        daemon thread so the stuck-killer can move on to other candidates
        without serialising 60s per kill.
