"""Global scenario scheduler for the scenario-pool architecture.

Owns the work queue, VRAM accounting, and parallel dispatch of grandchild
evaluator processes.  Replaces the per-planner serial for-loop that lives
inside the current ``_planner_runner_main``.

Key design points
-----------------
* VRAM is the only hard cap.  Capacity is emergent: ``effective_budget[gpu]``
  = ``(free_mib - safety_buffer) * oom_multiplier``; we dispatch iff
  ``required_mib <= effective_budget[gpu]``.
* "Required" = ``planner_vram_estimate`` + (``carla_vram_estimate`` iff we
  also need to start a new CARLA for this job -- if a warm instance of the
  right town already exists, only the planner cost counts).
* Weighted round-robin across planner sub-queues, weight proportional to
  ``1/mean_run_scenario_s`` per planner, so fast planners don't starve
  behind slow ones.
* All retry accounting and all terminal-outcome finalization
  (``write_run_status`` + ``finalize_failed_result_roots``) is preserved
  verbatim -- the scheduler is a relocation of today's logic, not a
  rewrite of validity guarantees.

This module is scheduler-only; process lifecycle for CARLA is in
:mod:`tools._carla_pool`.
