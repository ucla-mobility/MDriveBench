"""CARLA process pool for the scenario-pool scheduler.

This module defines a pool of long-lived CARLA server processes that are
leased out to grandchild evaluator processes one scenario at a time.

Key properties
--------------
* VRAM accounting is OWNED BY THE SCHEDULER, not the pool.  The pool only
  manages process lifecycle -- the scheduler decides when it is safe to start
  a new CARLA instance on a given GPU by consulting its own VRAM model and
  OOM penalty state.  When the scheduler has decided, it calls
  ``CarlaPool.start_instance(gpu_id, ...)`` which picks a free port from the
  GPU's candidate band and brings the process up.
* Leases are exclusive: one scenario holds a given CARLA at a time.  A
  concurrently running scenario gets its own lease on a different CARLA
  instance.  There is no notion of concurrent scenarios sharing one CARLA.
* Port selection is verified free before bind: each GPU has a *candidate*
  port band (e.g. ``2000 + gpu_id*20 + [0,4,8,12,16]``); the pool iterates
  the band and checks ``are_ports_available`` before binding.
* Recycle-on-crash only.  A successful ``release(lease, "clean")`` keeps the
  CARLA instance warm for the next lease (town preferred); there is no
  prophylactic K-scenario recycle.  A ``release(lease, "crashed")`` triggers
  kill + wait_for_port_close.  Construct the pool with ``no_reuse=True``
  to fall back to always-recycle behavior (useful for debugging /
  scenario-isolation).

This module is the process-lifecycle half of the scenario-pool redesign.
The scheduling/dispatch half lives in :mod:`tools._scheduler`.

        Rationale: CARLA reuse is great when a new scenario of the same
        town is queued right behind the previous one -- the instance
        stays CLEAN, its ~4 GB of VRAM is already allocated, and
        ``acquire_lease`` hands it back in milliseconds.  But if the
        queue drains of that town's scenarios (weighted-RR picked a
        different planner, the remaining towns are all different), the
        CLEAN instance sits there holding VRAM forever.  On a 30-CARLA
        baseline this typically means ~27 idle CLEANs holding ~100 GB
        across the fleet -- precisely the VRAM the scheduler needed to
        start fresh CARLAs elsewhere.

        We only stop instances that have been CLEAN for the full
        ``idle_recycle_seconds`` window and that have never held a

    verifies each candidate is free before binding; a candidate whose ports
    are occupied is silently skipped.

    ``slots`` is the candidate count per GPU -- NOT a concurrency cap.  The
    scheduler (which owns VRAM accounting) decides how many instances are
    actually started on each GPU; as long as at least one candidate in the
    band is free, a new instance can be created.  The default (64 slots,
    512-port span per GPU) is intentionally generous: it makes "no free
    port in band" unreachable under normal concurrency and still leaves
    TIME_WAIT headroom after instances are torn down, without colliding
    with the next GPU's band.  The linear walk in ``_find_free_port`` is
    O(slots) which is fine at this size.
